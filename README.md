The project consists of a web application that allows users to check the current weather of a specific location. 
It is developed using the JavaScript library React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
Bootstrap is also utilized to expedite the creation of a modern and visually appealing design.

The application leverages a weather API to fetch real-time meteorological data.
The workflow of the application is straightforward: upon loading the page, 
users can enter the name of a city or a specific location in a search field.
When submitting the query, the application sends a request to the weather API, 
which responds with relevant data such as the city name, 
temperature in degrees Celsius, among other details.
